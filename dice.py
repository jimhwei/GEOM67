#dice roll game
#get user random selection from 1 to 6, like a 6-sided dice
#compare to computer random choice
#if user and computer choice match or is higher than computer choice, user wins
#turtle moves forward if user wins
#invalid inputs handled: integers less than 0 or greater than 7, negative integers,
# and string values
#play continues until user wins
#input for user recieved by keyboard entry and promps
